> Add scope rendering

	Need to add window clipping -- see tek

	Should probably generate one .wav file per frame from "main"
	e.g. out.0001.wav, out.0002.wav, etc.

	Then later, "shoot" them with a shoot script that:

		1. Opens the camera shutter
		2. Plays the .wav file to the scope to trace out the image
		3. Closes the camera shutter

	A test program that generates e.g. a circle and cross over and over
	might be good.

> Fix lookat: not centering if window's width is different than height

> Fix lookat: seems to be an inverted matrix?
  Putting an object at the lookat position doesn't work,
  you have to put it at the negative position, e.g. -x,-y,-z
  for it to be seen.

> See images/Makefile for how to add a neon glow to the wireframe image:

	grid-0001.png -- input
	comp-0001.png -- output

> Implement a way to screencapture + process each frame on mac using new Fl_Window::get_win_id() feature
  Done: Added get_win_id branch on fltk fork at: https://github.com/erco77/fltk/

> Not sure, but I think TransformHandler needs a 'translate' operation.
  Currently translations can be applied directly to DrawableObject and Point3D.

> Create a test-tek4010 app to draw an X on the tek4010 terminal.
  (All the other output drivers have test programs.. this one should too)
